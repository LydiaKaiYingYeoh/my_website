# Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance

Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the [Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS)](https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/index.htm) survey, where it takes data from high schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns. You will work with a selected group of variables from a random sample of observations during one of the years the YRBSS was conducted.

## Load the data

This data is part of the `openintro` textbook and we can load and inspect it. There are observations on 13 different variables, some categorical and some numerical. The meaning of each variable can be found by bringing up the help file:

?yrbss

```{r}
data(yrbss)
glimpse(yrbss)
skim(yrbss)
```

Before you carry on with your analysis, it's is always a good idea to check with `skimr::skim()` to get a feel for missing values, summary statistics of numerical variables, and a very rough histogram.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

You will first start with analyzing the `weight` of participants in kilograms. Using visualization and summary statistics, describe the distribution of weights. How many observations are we missing weights from?

```{r, eda_on_weight}
# As shown from the skim function, there are 1004 missing values for the "weight" variable
yrbss %>% 
  filter(!is.na(weight)) %>% 
  summarise(mean_weight = mean(weight),
          median_weight = median(weight),
          max_weight = max(weight),
          min_weight = min(weight),
          std_weight = sd(weight))

yrbss %>% 
ggplot(aes(x= weight)) +
  geom_density() +
  theme_bw() +
  xlab("Weight") +
  ylab("Frequancy") +
  ggtitle("Distribution of weight")

# The distribution is right skewed  

```

Next, consider the possible relationship between a high schooler’s weight and their physical activity. Plotting the data is a useful first step because it helps us quickly visualize trends, identify strong associations, and develop research questions.

Let’s create a new variable `physical_3plus`, which will be `yes` if they are physically active for at least 3 days a week, and `no` otherwise.

  
```{r}
yrbss <- yrbss %>% 
  mutate(physical_3plus = ifelse(physically_active_7d >= 3, "yes", "no"))

yrbss_table <- yrbss %>% 
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  group_by(physical_3plus) %>% 
  summarise(count = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop= count/sum(count))

yrbss_table
yrbss_table$prop[1]

```
Can you provide a 95% confidence interval for the population proportion of high schools that are *NOT* active 3 or more days per week?
```{r}
formula_ci <- yrbss %>% 
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>%
  summarise(count = n(),
            t_critical=qt(0.975,count-1),
            se_prop=sqrt(yrbss_table$prop[1]*(1-yrbss_table$prop[1])/count),
            margin_of_error=t_critical*se_prop,
            prop_low=yrbss_table$prop[1]-margin_of_error,
            prop_high=yrbss_table$prop[1]+margin_of_error)
formula_ci

```
Make a boxplot of `physical_3plus` vs. `weight`. Is there a relationship between these two variables? What did you expect and why?

```{r, boxplot}
yrbss %>% 
  filter(!is.na(physical_3plus)) %>% 
  ggplot( aes(y = reorder(physical_3plus, weight), x = weight)) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
  labs(title = "Physical activity does not affect weight", x = "weight", y = "physically active for at least 3 days a week")

# We expected physical activity to be a driver of weight however the data shows that that might not be the case 
```
