# IMDB ratings: Differences between directors

Recall the IMBD ratings data. I would like you to explore whether the mean IMDB rating for Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton are the same or not. I have already calculated the confidence intervals for the mean ratings of these two directors and as you can see they overlap. 


```{r directors, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("images", "directors.png"), error = FALSE)
```

First, I would like you to reproduce this graph. You may find `geom_errorbar()` and `geom_rect()` useful.

In addition, you will run a hpothesis test. You should use both the `t.test` command and the `infer` package to simulate from a null distribution, where you assume zero difference between the two.

> Before anything, write down the null and alternative hypotheses, as well as the resulting test statistic and the associated t-stat or p-value. At the end of the day, what do you conclude?

You can load the data and examine its structure

```{r load-movies-data}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
```

Your R code and analysis should go here. If you want to insert a blank chunk of R code you can just hit `Ctrl/Cmd+Alt+I` 

```{r}

directors_ci <- movies %>%
  filter(director %in% c("Steven Spielberg", "Tim Burton")) %>%
  filter(!is.na(rating)) %>% 
  group_by(director) %>%
  summarise(
	mean_rating = mean(rating),
            sd_rating = sd(rating),
            count = n(),
            tcritical = qt(.975, count-1),
            ste = sd_rating/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = tcritical*ste,
            ci_low = mean_rating - margin_of_error,
            ci_high = mean_rating + margin_of_error
	)

ggplot(directors_ci,
       aes(y = reorder(director, mean_rating),
           x = mean_rating,
           colour = director)) +
  geom_point(size=2) +
  geom_errorbar(width = .1, aes(xmin = ci_low, xmax = ci_high), lwd = 1.75) +
  geom_text(aes(label=round(mean_rating,2)),hjust=0.5, vjust=-2,
            size=5) +

                          xmax = 7.33, 
                          ymin = 0, 
                          ymax = 3), 
            colour = "grey", 
            alpha= 0.4) +
  labs(x = "Mean IMDB Rating",
       y = " ",
       title = "Do Spielberg and Burton have the same mean IMDB rating?",
       subtitle = "95% confidence intervals overlap") +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

# With a p-value of 0.01 that is lower 0.05 we reject the null hypothesis and observe a significant difference
